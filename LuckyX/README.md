# LuckyX Auction & Staking DApp

LuckyX is a blockchain-based decentralized application (DApp) enabling users to participate in 100 auction rounds by depositing DripX tokens. In return, users receive LuckyX tokens proportional to their deposits for each auction round. The project aims to provide an exciting and fair reward mechanism, leveraging smart contracts to automate and secure all processes.
In addition to the auction system, LuckyX offers a staking platform where participants can stake LuckyX tokens to earn additional rewards through a fairness lottery mechanism

This project is still in testing!

The whitepaper can be found here: PM Link. The project has the following elements:

- The folder /contracts contains the Solidity contracts for the tokens, the auction and the staking dApp.
- The folder /frontend contains the React App frontend, and a backend end server.js file

More information is coming soon!!
