# 🧱 Solidity Projects

This repository contains a collection of smart contract–based decentralized applications (DApps) built using **Solidity**, with full-stack support including frontend interfaces and optional backend logic.

These projects cover real-world decentralized use cases such as **auctions**, **staking**, **lotteries**, and **token distributions**.
